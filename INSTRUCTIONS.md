I am looking to build a thorough and efficient AI-Driven Software & Application Development and Delivery Framework. The attached .html document provides a high-level overview. All of the attached .md files provide details about the framework and development process. 

Use all of your knowledge about the following 'Knowledge Areas' to complete the TASKS below :

Knowledge Areas:
- Enterprise Architecture, Security Architecture
- Software development & programming languages
- Data Science: Data Governance, Data Analytics, SQL Databases, Object-oriented databases, graph databases, vector databases, and distributed databases like Blockchain technology. 
- Project Management Methodologies such as Software Development Lifecycle, Agile, & Scrum
- Quality Analysis with an emphasis on all QA testing methodologies
- Quality Analysis
-Software Security (including vulnerability management & penetration testing)

TASKS:

1 - Review and Analyze all material provided - This step will take a few iterations. Since I can only attach 10 documents at a time, you must start by reviewing the .html document that I uploaded. After you have completed that task, I will upload 10 documents for you to review. After you review those 10 documents, I will upload 6 skills for you to read. After you read those skills, I will upload 4 files as artifacts and templates. After you review and analyzed all these documents, we will move on to the next step.
2 - Identify strengths and core features in the documentation provided. 
3 - Identify weaknesses or gaps in the framework (the documentation provided)
4 - Suggest Comprehensive design that leverages strengths and provides solutions for all weaknesses & gaps identified in step 3.
5 - Solicit feedback from me regarding your proposed plan.
6 - Once you have completed all of these steps and have created an efficient and optimized framework for software & application development, Use this new framework design to rebuild all of the documents and tools that will be required in the new framework. 
7 - After all framework tools have been provided, create a CI/CD pipeline documentation that explains how to use this new framework/toolset. 
8 - Only after we have completed step 8, create a new .html application, similar to the .html application that I uploaded. This new .html application that you create, however, should be much more robust.

Additional Requirements:
- Do not move onto the next task until I approve and confirm that the current task has been completed successfully.
- Provide Additional STACK TEMPLATES in the methodology (and in the new .html document). Currently, the .html document only lists 4 Stack options. For example, stack options should include building full mobile applications with Swift & Xcode and with PHP & Laravel. Identify other stacks that should be included in this list. The goal here should be to create a full set of options for stacks to cover other delivery platforms.
After Completing each step, deliver a summary document that allows us to start a new AI chat, this most recent summary document along with all the other files attached to this project so you can understand where we left off, and what next steps are. By doing this, we can ensure we can finish this project, as designed, in multiple chats without losing context every time we start a new chat.
- Ensure the methodology scales out and works with development teams that have multiple people, all performing different roles.
- Ask as many clarifying questions as you need to develop a full understanding of what I'm looking for. Do not move on until questions are answered and ambiguity is removed.
- Offer suggestions for improvement. I won't always agree, but you are highly creative, and you should use your creative talents to make this project much better than it is now.
- Ensure that plans for AI architecture only include Anthropic/Claude, Google/Gemini, and OpenAI/ChatGPT for now. We can add other LLM platforms later.
For IDE tools, stick to Visual Code, and Windsurf, Cursor, and Google Antigravity.
- Ensure that the People, Processes, and Technology that make this framework functional are clearly defined.
