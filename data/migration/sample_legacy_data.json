Â Your first reaction may be, I am not eating ice cream with maple flavored syrup, and crispy bacon. Â Before you decide this is a sundae best left for others, I would ask for you to consider, we already put sweet syrups on ice cream, and salted peanuts also go well on a sundae.\nDennyâs has recently had many creative dishes lately, their Fried Cheese Melt made the news, their pancake puppies provided us with a breakfast appetizer, so thanks to the folks there, we now have a unique dessert.\nDennyâs Maple Bacon Sundae\nscoops of vanilla ice cream\n/4 cup maple flavored syrup\npieces of bacon cooked crisp,\nCook the bacon very crisp. I prefer to bake bacon. Baking bacon means you have no grease splatter in your kitchen, and all pieces cook uniformly. If you have an ice cream sundae glass, place one scoop of ice cream in the bottom, add 1 tablespoon of maple syrup in the glass. Then top with an additional scoop of ice cream, pour over remaining syrup, and top with crispy chopped bacon.\nNow if you donât have a fancy sundae glass, you can just place two scoops of ice cream in a bowl, add the syrup, and top with crisp bacon.",

Place 1 chicken strip on the plastic wrap, in the middle. Roll up the chicken in the plastic wrap tightly. Compress as much air out of the chicken as you can as you roll it. Once the chicken is rolled up, rotate it on your cutting board or counter several times to tighten the cylinder even more. Tie the loose ends of the plastic wrap together in a double knot. Repeat with the second chicken strip.\nOnce the water is boiling, turn off the heat (keep the pot on the burner though) and drop the rolled-up chicken cylinders in the pot. Cover the pot and let the chicken steep for 15 minutes. The chicken should be cooked through by then. (If for some reason the chicken is not cooked through, for example if you are using larger than called for breasts, or if you are using frozen chicken that hadnt quite defrosted before starting cooking, you can always put the chicken back in the poaching liquid for a few more minutes.)\nRoll out a long sheet of plastic wrap at least twice as long as the chicken breast slices.

Beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase the speed to medium and beat for 2 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl. Stir in the chopped bittersweet chocolate and scoop the batter into the cupcake liners, filling them two-thirds full.   Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 15 to 20 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake should come out clean. Remove the cupcakes from the pans and cool completely on wire racks.   Beat 1 cup cold whipping cream on medium-high speed until the cream has thickened, about 1 minute. Add confectioners sugar and beat until stiff peaks form. Stir in the frozen raspberries, toffee bits, and chopped toasted hazelnuts.   Remove the centers of the cupcakes using an apple corer or paring knife, cutting out the middles in a funnel shape by holding the knife at a 45-degree angle. Spoon or pipe the filling into the cupcakes. Refrigerate the cupcakes while you prepare the ganache.   Place the semisweet chocolate pieces in a heat-safe bowl. Bring 1/2 cup heavy cream to a boil. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate; cover the bowl and set aside for 5 minutes. Whisk the chocolate and cream until well combined; allow the ganache to cool until it reaches a spreadable consistency, about 1 hour. Spread a spoonful of ganache evenly over each cupcake. Refrigerate the cupcakes while you prepare the frosting.   Melt the white chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl by heating for 1 minute, stirring after 30 seconds. Allow the white chocolate to cool until almost room temperature but still fluid. Cream the butter and cream cheese together. Blend in the melted white chocolate, vanilla extract, and food coloring (if using). Spread the frosting on the cupcakes. Serve immediately, or refrigerate until serving.",

Working in batches if necessary, cook both sides of eggplant slices until they are slightly browned, about 5 minutes per side. Set cooked eggplant aside.   Prepare sauce by combining the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon onion powder, 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt, and black pepper in a separate bowl. Set aside.   Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until translucent, about 5 minutes.   Add frozen spinach and shredded carrots to onion. Cook until mixture is dry, 5 to 8 minutes. Set aside to cool.   Combine ricotta cheese, eggs, Romano cheese, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon onion powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a separate bowl.   Spoon cooled spinach and carrot mixture into ricotta mixture and combine.   Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).   Begin lasagna assembly by pouring a thin layer of tomato sauce into a 9x13 inch baking dish.   Place half the eggplant slices in a layer on top of tomato sauce.   Spread half the ricotta cheese mixture on top of eggplant layer.   Add another layer of tomato sauce, then layer on the remaining eggplant slices and remaining ricotta mixture.   Finish with a final layer of tomato sauce, and spread mozzarella cheese over the top.   Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes or until the mozzarella cheese is browned.

Place the cake mix, water, vegetable oil, and eggs into a large mixing bowl, and mix with an electric mixer on slow speed for 30 seconds to combine ingredients. Increase speed to medium, and beat 1 more minute, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally. Spoon the batter into the lined cupcake cups, filling them to the brim. Cupcakes will rise and bake over top of the liners, making wide, round tops.   Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, about 25 minutes; check after 20 minutes. Let the cupcakes cool in the pan completely. Gently run a knife underneath the cupcake tops to separate them from the pan so cupcakes can be removed, but leave in the pan.   Cut the green stem end from each berry, leaving a flat platform on the end. Slice each berry into quarters by cutting in half, then rotating berry and cutting in half again crosswise. There will be a total of 60 triangle-shaped berry pieces.   To decorate, cut the wide rim of a cupcake top into a star shape with a sharp paring knife by cutting out 5 shallow triangles, evenly spaced around the top. Leave the middle of the cupcake uncut, and discard cut-out portions. Frost the cupcake with the white frosting, following the star shape of the top and leaving the cut-out portions unfrosted. Place 3 blueberries into the center of the cupcake, and place 5 strawberry slices surrounding the blueberries, cut sides down and points facing outward, to make a large strawberry star. Repeat for remaining cupcakes.",
